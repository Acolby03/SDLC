# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by looking at the acceptance criteria in each user story and thinking about how the feature should work from the end user’s perspective. User stories break down the bigger requirements into smaller, testable pieces. This makes it easier to understand what the client actually wants and gives the team a clear target. In the SNHU Travel project, for example, I tested the Customized Top Destination List in smaller steps, which helped the developers deliver exactly what the client asked for.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach development by breaking the work into smaller chunks and making sure features are tested as soon as they’re ready. Agile processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives help keep the team aligned and flexible. I want to carry these into future projects because they allow for quick adjustments when requirements change and give everyone on the team a chance to contribute. For me, Agile makes the most sense because it keeps development focused on delivering value in small increments instead of waiting until the end.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating clearly, giving feedback, and supporting the rest of the team so we can deliver a working product together. In this project, I made sure to let developers know when features didn’t work as expected and explained why, which helped us fix problems before the sprint ended. A good team member stays engaged, respects other roles, and adapts when the plan changes so that the whole team can succeed.
